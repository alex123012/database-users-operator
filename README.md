# database-users-operator

Kubernetes operator to create and manage users and roles for various SQL and NoSQL databases (currently supports PostgreSQL, CockroachDB). This repository contains a [custom controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) and [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) designed for the lifecycle (creation, update privileges, deletion) of a different databases users/roles.

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/database-users-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/database-users-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

```bash

user=root
for key in $(kubectl get secrets cockroachdb-${user} -oyaml | yq '.data | keys | .[]'); do kubectl get secrets cockroachdb-${user} -oyaml | key=$key yq '.data[strenv(key)]' | base64 -d | tee tmp/$(if [[ $key == "tls.key" ]]; then echo "client.${user}.key"; elif [[ $key == "tls.crt" ]]; then echo "client.${user}.crt"; else echo "ca.crt"; fi); done
```

# TODO
- [x] Auto remove user from all dbs listed in databaseConfig when User CR deleted
- [ ] Add webhook validation for config and user CR
- [ ] Auto delete user from DB on databaseConfig entry remove from User CR
- [ ] Check compability with different postgres versions
- [ ] Add MySQL support
